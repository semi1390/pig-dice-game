Game of Pig Rules
There are two players. Each player takes turns rolling a pair of dice.
The total of the current player's roll is added to their score, unless either 
die comes up as a “one”. 
If this happens, this player's turn is over, and it becomes the other 
player’s turn. After each roll, the current player 
can either roll again, (assuming a “one” was not rolled) or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. 
The first player to get 30 points or higher wins.
If a player rolls two “ones” (snake eyes), that 
player's current score gets zeroed out, and they 
have to start over, accumulating points from zero.![pig dice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102389283/189552129-de943ed9-a5a4-4f71-ada7-d6fbca117e11.jpg)
